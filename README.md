# Machinate

Machinate is a personal project meant to:

1. Refine my skills in C/C++ and game engine technology/architecture;
2. Expand my knowledge about optimisation, API design, and concurrency;
3. Explore to find the best parts of the C++ library ecosystem;
4. Learn graphics technology by way of Vulkan;
5. Provide, if the project matures enough, a fully 3D spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon Deluxe like Planet Coaster provided for Roller Coaster Tycoon.
